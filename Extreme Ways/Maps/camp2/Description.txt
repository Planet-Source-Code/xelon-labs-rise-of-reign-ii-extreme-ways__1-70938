Commander!
	Your defense tactics are appreciated by the whole base.
But as our research told us that we are not alone who came here
Every thing in miles is yet to come back. It means that facing much
two enemies is a big task. One is ULPF and other is UNPF.
	According to our plan we have to join hands with ULPF.
Only then we will be able to drive aliens out of our planet.
But the history tells itself ULPF can never be with us. We have plan 
for this. 
	Scientists have located exact coordinates of the destroyer
and the location is in front of ULPF base. Task is easy. ULPF cannot
resist attack by aliens and if we help them they would probably also
help us.
	Your mission is to hold the attacks of UPF until aliens arrive
and don’t let the command centers be destroyed. Only then our mission
might succeed. 
						Best of Luck

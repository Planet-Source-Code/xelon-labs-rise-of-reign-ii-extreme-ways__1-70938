Commander!
	Consider this your final sortie.
	You have to report to the established base. Take in charge of it and destroy the 
main seed.
	According to intelligence, There is an enemy structure near the base.
Further reports tell us that the structure is a sort of weather controller. It can take control
over lightening and destroy enemy structures. According to its dimensions it looks like a 
sort of Mass Destruction machine. The turret above it can be found deadly and with its 
giant legs it looks like a mass crusher. Fortunately it is under construction. We want it 
destroyed commander. The Disrupter fixed in satellite won't work until the weather
conditions get normal.
	Our Hi-Tech Robot Tank technology is being stolen. The Aliens modify our tanks,
Increase its armor and use them against us. According to intelligence this whole activity
is being done in Planetary Destroyer. If we rescue some robot tanks from that Destroyer,
they are surely going to help us. 
Once that structure is destroyed we can use the disrupter to freeze any enemy attacks.

							Best of Luck Commander!

Commander!
	Good to have you back,
	Considering the current war crisis, our expert scientists’ team
has built the Time Machine. Your duty is to hold any enemy attacks until
the Time Machine is ready.
	Unfortunately your task is not much easy. The enemy side has 
got much power and stolen technology. Holding the enemy attacks is 
somewhat more difficult. You have been provided already established 
base and advanced weapons.
						Good Luck,
				You have to fulfill our last hope

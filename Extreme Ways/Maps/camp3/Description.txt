Congrats Commander!
	The ULPF are finally with us.
	Our steps are being watched by the enemy.
We are very percent sure that enemy is going to destroy the talks between
ULPF and Us. For the defense the base has elected you. The already 
established base will prove good for us. You have to hold any enemy attacks
and destroy that Planetary Destroyer. It is our only leading hope.
The Generals of the two federations will be on meeting. If the talks are found
successful then the victory is not far beyond.
					Good Luck Commander!

General!
	Very pleased to hear about your promotion, You really deserved it.
Every thing is normal now the disrupter fixed in Ion Cannon works. It stops
any further reinforcements from S-1129. The remaining Alien forces were 
destroyed by the Ion Cannon and joint hard work of ULPF and Us.
	We did a very grave mistake in the past. The ULPF was the federation
which worked for humanity and in shadows it worked as a resistance against 
any extra terrestrials. The weapons they were making in past were for sole 
protection against aliens. The Disrupter was the only shield which could resist
attacks. They knew that our earth is in danger so they risked their lives and went
to other universes and make defense weapons.
	And by your support we are finally able to recognize them.

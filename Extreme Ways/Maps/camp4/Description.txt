Commander!
	Good to have you back. As the current affairs tell us you have been very important
Individual in many spheres. You have been recognized as the "Ambassador". But it is not over
yet. The talks were successful. According to the decision. We have to Launch a Global Defense
Satellite which would have the ability to target any location on earth. The Cannon of Satellite
would carry the projectile of our latest Ion Technology and the warhead of  ULPF Disrupter 
Technology.
	As according to the plan we already made the satellite in future. It will take some 
time to have the Disrupter technology in it.
	Until then your foremost objective is to defend the satellite at all costs.
								Good Luck
